## 1. Problem Statement

**The User:** Ambitious but overwhelmed students (High School & University).

**The Issue:** Students are drowning in information but starving for wisdom. They have access to textbooks, lectures, and notes, but lack the personalized guidance to process this information efficiently. They struggle to identify *what* they don't know until the test is in front of them. Traditional study tools are passive trackers (timers) or disconnected flashcards, failing to address the *quality* of study time or the *synthesis* of course material.

**The Impact:**
*   **Inefficiency:** Students spend hours "studying" (re-reading passive text) with low retention.
*   **Burnout:** Lack of progress visibility leads to anxiety and disengagement.
*   **Knowledge Fragmentation:** Concepts remain isolated in different notebooks/PDFs rather than forming a cohesive understanding.

## 2. Product Vision

**"The Pocket Sensei"** is an AI-first study companion that turns passive content into active mastery. It does not just store files; it *understands* them. By actively ingesting the student's specific materials (notes, slides, textbooks), it acts as a personalized tutor that manages the "what," "when," and "how" of studying, allowing the student to focus purely on learning.

**Core Philosophy:** "Don't just track time. Optimize the mind."

## 3. Core Solution Pillars

### A. The "Active Upload" Engine (Input Strategy)
*   **Mechanism:** Users manually upload their specific learning materials (PDFs, images of handwritten notes, syllabi).
*   **Value:** Ensures the AI is coaching based on the *exact* curriculum the student is being tested on, not generic web content.
*   **Key Feature:** "Instant Gratification Loop" — immediate generation of summaries and quizzes upon upload to reward the effort.

### B. Adaptive Curriculum (Spaced Repetition 2.0)
*   **Mechanism:** Dynamic scheduling of reviews based on performance, not just time.
*   **Value:** Eliminates decision fatigue ("What should I study today?"). The Sensei prioritizes weak spots and optimizes retention curves.

### C. The Persistent Knowledge Graph
*   **Mechanism:** Interlinks concepts across different uploads.
*   **Value:** Contextualizes learning. It connects a new Chemistry concept to a Biology note from three weeks ago, mimicking a deep understanding of the subject matter.

### D. The Socratic Guide
*   **Mechanism:** An interactive chat interface that guides students to answers via questions rather than direct information retrieval.
*   **Value:** Builds critical thinking and neural pathways for long-term retention.

## 4. Initial Success Metrics (KPIs)

1.  **Time-to-Value:** Average time from "Upload Complete" to "First Quiz Question Attempted" (Target: < 30 seconds).
2.  **Retention Rate:** % of users who return to review a concept >3 days after initial learning.
3.  **Upload Volume:** Average number of documents uploaded per active user per week.
