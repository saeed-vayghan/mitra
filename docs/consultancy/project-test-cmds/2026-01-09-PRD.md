## 1. Executive Summary
"The Pocket Sensei" is an AI-first mobile study companion designed for students to convert passive course materials into active mastery. By focusing on "Active Uploads" and "Socratic Coaching," it solves the problem of information overload and poor retention in academic environments.

## 2. Problem Statement
Students are drowning in content (PDFs, slides, notes) but lack the tools to synthesize this into long-term knowledge. Traditional study apps focus on time-tracking or manual flashcard creation, which increases cognitive load. Students need a coach that understands *their* specific material and tells them *what* to study and *when*.

## 3. Success Metrics (KPIs)
*   **Time-to-Value (TTV):** < 30 seconds from document upload to first AI-generated quiz question.
*   **Retention Rate:** % of users returning to review a concept >3 days after initial ingestion.
*   **Study Efficiency:** User-reported confidence score increase after 3 "Sensei Sessions."
*   **Upload Volume:** Average of 5+ documents uploaded per active user per week.

## 4. User Personas
### Primary: The Overwhelmed Academic (University/Higher Ed)
*   **Needs:** To process massive amounts of technical data (STEM, Law, Med) quickly.
*   **Goal:** Efficient mastery and exam readiness without burnout.

### Secondary: The High School Achiever
*   **Needs:** To organize multiple subjects and prepare for standardized testing.
*   **Goal:** Structured study habits and immediate feedback on comprehension.

## 5. User Stories
| ID | User Story | Priority |
|:---|:---|:---|
| US.1 | As a student, I want to upload PDFs/Photos of my notes so the AI learns my specific curriculum. | P0 |
| US.2 | As a student, I want AI-generated Socratic quizzes based on my notes so I can test my knowledge. | P0 |
| US.3 | As a student, I want to be notified when I'm about to forget a concept so I can refresh it. | P1 |
| US.4 | As a student, I want a "Brain Map" that links concepts across different uploads. | P2 |

## 6. Functional Requirements
### 6.1. Active Ingestion Engine (P0)
*   Support for PDF, JPG, PNG.
*   OCR must maintain structural hierarchy (headings, bullet points).
*   **AC:** Process a 10-page PDF in < 20 seconds.

### 6.2. Socratic Quiz Interface (P0)
*   Multiple Choice, True/False, and Short Answer formats.
*   "Hint" system: AI provides conceptual clues before revealing the answer.
*   **AC:** Every question must be directly traceable to an uploaded source.

### 6.3. Adaptive Study Dashboard (P1)
*   Daily "To-Study" list prioritized by the AI's estimation of the user's "Forgetting Curve."
*   **AC:** Visual indicator (e.g., color-coded) of knowledge strength for each topic.

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements
### 7.1. Technical Constraints
*   **Platform:** Mobile-First (Native or High-Perf Cross-Platform).
*   **AI:** GPT-4o / Claude 3.5 Sonnet (or equivalent) for reasoning.
*   **Storage:** Vector Database for semantic search and cross-document linking.

### 7.2. Performance & Security
*   **Privacy:** User data must be encrypted and isolated; no cross-user data leakage.
*   **Latency:** Interaction feedback (hints/grading) must be < 1.5 seconds.
*   **Reliability:** 99.9% uptime for core study sessions.
