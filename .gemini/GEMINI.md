# Project Context: AI Agents Party

## 🧠 Memory & Preferences
- **Communication Language**: English


## 🦅 Mitra System
This project uses the **Mitra** multi-agent system for AI Agent Party and discussion. It enables a collaborative environment where specialized agents work together to solve complex problems.

### Agents
See the [Agent Registry](../mitra/agents/registry.md) for a full list of available agents and their capabilities.

### Key Features
- **Memory Persistence**: Use `*save` and `*load` to maintain session context across all agents.
- **Consultancy Mode**: Agents provide high-level strategy and specs, not direct implementation code.

### Key Files & Folders
- **Gemini CLI Configs**: `.gemini/`
- **Antigravity Configs**: `.agent/`
- **Agent Registry**: `mitra/agents/registry.md`
- **Party Guide**: `mitra/docs/party_mode.md`
- **Command Definitions**: `.gemini/commands/`
